<h2> In a Nutshell </h2>
<img src="./data/images/info.png">
To build the models yourself please run
```bash
bash build.sh
```
To play against AI-Friendly run
```bash
bash play-first.sh
```
If you want to be the "X", or 
```bash
bash play-second.sh
```
If you want to be the "O"
<br>
Finally: if you want to make it more intelligent then run
```bash
bash enhace.sh
```
(as much times as you want, suggested: start with one)

<h1>More Info:</h1>

<h2>1) How did AI-Friendly learned to play Tic-Tac-Toe?</h2>
<i>AI-Friendly was able to learn how to play Tic-Tac-Toe by finding patterns in a tic-tac-toe database.</i>

<h2>2) Does this problem differs from other problems that AI-Friendly solved?</h2>
<i>Yes, the present task stands out in the context of it being what is called 'pattern recognition'</i>

<h2>3) What are the main differences between pattern-recognition tasks and pure-classification tasks?</h2>
<i>In pure-classification tasks the objects tend to be uniquely defined: a chair is 100% a chair and a cat is 100% a cat; wether in this problem which involves pattern-recognition one same move in the training database may be sometimes tagged as "a good move" and other times as "a bad move".</i>

<h2>4) How was the database generated?</h2>
<i>A training database was generated by defining a class with an attribute that makes a random move, instantiating two of such objects and finally making them both play against each other. The result was a collection of ~ 10k tic-tac-toe games</i>

<h2>5) Training with the randomly-generated database leads to an insatisfactory amount of intelligence. What can I do?</h2>
<i>You can re-train it against itself and thus make it smarter by running</i>
```bash
bash enhace.sh
```
